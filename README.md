## Clean Talk - Best HTTP API Service üê∫

Here you will find the source code with its respective use and use cases this is totally free for everyone, currently it is an ongoing project with the simple module completed.

You can find the simple route in the main branch, and in the secondary branch I will be uploading the tests for something more robust, a mini AI using the NPL protocol for text parsing. 

## Features

- [x] Simple verification.

- [x] API for HTTP requests.

- [ ] Robust verification.

## Differences

With the simple verification you can know if a text contains any obscene words, the simple version brings a series of blacklisted words in different languages.

With the robust verification you can determine if a text contains obscene words BUT you can also tell if the person is speaking off key or in a rude, abusive or annoying tone.

You can add your own additional words to your liking in a module that will be enabled soon.
